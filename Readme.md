## About Me

**Hey, I'm Yash Pundhir**

- I'm 23 and I live in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh. I'm currently learning **Full Stack Web Development** in `MERN` Stack.

---

## Project Description

- In this project I have built a **Street Style Landing Page** from the scratch using core `HTML` & `CSS`

- This project heavily relies on **CSS Positions**.

- Note that I haven't made it **Responsive** to **Different Screen Sizes**, so it will work only on the laptop screen. If you are using Desktop, please zoom in or out, that might work.

---

## Technologies Used

- HTML

- CSS

---

## What I have Learnt in this Project

- Good Understanding of `HTML` & `CSS`.

- `float` property of CSS:

  - how the `float` property can be used to **align the corresponding elements on the screen wrt the position of the current element**.

- CSS Positions:

  - learnt about the **positioning** of different **objects and images**.

  - learnt about how to place **one image on top of another image**.

---

## Time Taken to Finish this Project

> I have taken around **4 hours** to complete this project as the concept of **Positions** in `CSS` was new for me to implement .

---

I'm definitely more confident now in using `CSS` **Positions** in my future projects.
